#### Description

This Python script visualizes the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator by utilizing a simple Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
It concludes by building a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

#### Observable Trends

* As we move closer towards the equator, temperature increases.

* Likewise, as we move towards the equator, wind speed also decreases.

* Cloudiness has no evident correlation between temperature and latitude, as cloudiness seems to increase at both high and low temperatures and latitudes.
